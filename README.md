# WeatherDisplay

An E-ink display that displays the current weather using Arduino software and Openweathermap API. It connects to Wi-Fi using ESP8266 Wi-Fi module and gets its power from a small 380 mAh battery. Due to E-ink display consuming power only when updated and the small update frequency needed for a weather display, the device's power consumption is extremely low.
